## **Technologies**

[![Express.js](https://img.shields.io/badge/Express.js-4.17.2-ececec?logo=Express&logoColor=fff)](https://expressjs.org)

I found creating and API with Express.js routers rather simple. Implementing my API architecture was easy and low-pressure when it came to creating the routes, managing headers and parameters. Managing all possible outcomes and HTTP codes happend to be much more difficult at first, probably due to a lack of understanding how the middleware works on my end.

[![Sequelize](https://img.shields.io/badge/Sequelize-v6-03AFEF?logo=Sequelize&logoColor=fff)](https://www.sequelize.org/) [![MySQL](https://img.shields.io/badge/MySQL-8.0-F29111?logo=mySQL&logoColor=fff)](https://www.mysql.com/)

This was my first-time using Sequelize in a project. It's a surprisingly complex ORM for SQL database solutions but the documentation explains everything well and the project was developed rather quickly using it. Having a model of data and a tool for migrations was such a relief further into the development I went.
